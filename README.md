JWT Authentication with Spring Security
This project demonstrates how to implement JWT-based authentication in a Spring Boot application with Spring Security and PostgreSQL. It secures API endpoints and provides a stateless authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building the application.
Spring Security: To handle authentication and authorization.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For stateless authentication.
PostgreSQL: Database for storing user information and roles.
Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, etc.).


Features
JWT Authentication: Secure endpoints using JWT tokens.
Role-based Access: Role-based access control to manage user permissions.
Stateless Security: No need for session management, making the system scalable.
Setup Guide
Prerequisites
JDK 11 or higher.
PostgreSQL installed locally or remotely.
Maven or Gradle (depending on your preference).
