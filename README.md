## Introduction
This project is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. It uses PostgreSQL for database management, Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, and Spring Security for securing the application.

## Features
- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control
- Secure APIs with Spring Security
- PostgreSQL database integration

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure token-based authentication
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code in Java
- **Spring Security**: For securing the applicationâ€™s APIs

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Configure the database**:
    Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database running and update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your database details.

3. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

## Configuration
Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with the following properties:

```properties
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your-db
    username: db-username
    password: db-password
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: true
    database: postgresql
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```

## Usage

Register a new user: Send a POST request to /api/auth/register with a JSON payload containing username, password, and role.

Login: Send a POST request to /api/auth/login with a JSON payload containing username and password. The response will include a JWT token.

Access secure endpoints: Include the JWT token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token to access secure endpoints.

## Endpoints

POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user

POST /api/auth/login: Login and obtain a JWT token

GET /api/secure-endpoint: Access this endpoint by including the JWT token in the Authorization header
